Most of the code is adapted from the official MEAN repository (https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/MEAN).

Since MEAN is primarily a generative model, we have modified it to output only the logits for each mutation.

For reproducibility, you can run the model using the following script:

```
bash scripts/run_mean.sh
```
